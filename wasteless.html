            Food waste will become one of the biggest environmental challenges
            in the future. In Swedish school restaurants tons of food is being
            thrown away every day. A large part of the dilemma lies in the
            unawareness of the problem. To overcome this and reach out,
            knowledge and information are needed. <br /><br />Wasteless is an
            app which aims to help Swedish schools to reduce food waste.

          <p>
            Wasteless draws attention to the food waste problem in Swedish
            school canteens. The participating students compete to get the
            highest score, which means the least waste. By using elements from
            game design, the app can utilize the triggers and driving forces
            experienced in-game contexts, contributing to increased motivation,
            commitment, and fun. In addition, the school management gets access
            to the data generated from the app. This way, the meal routines in
            school canteens can be improved, which not only saves the earth’s
            resources, but also improves school finances.

            It was essential to get a playful and friendly feeling to the design
            to remove the sense of "a boring topic" that many may associate with
            food waste. Therefore a friendly and casual language was used to
            induce a warm feeling. Furthermore, large border-radius and rounded
            shapes were used that, combined with the intriguing illustrations
            and images, lifts the sense of a fun and straightforward design that
            can entice users to see the joy in the product.

            In each dining room where Wasteless is used, a digital scale will be
            available for the students to use.Through scan technology, the
            number of grams and the corresponding score are entered. This is
            done automatically to minimize the risk of cheating among users.

            The admin page is available for principals, teachers, and catering
            staff. The management team can measure everything from active users,
            days and dishes with the most and least wastage to detailed food
            waste statistics. Based on this, various measures can be taken to
            find new routines that can improve the food waste statistics in
            schools.
