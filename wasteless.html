            Food waste will become one of the biggest environmental challenges in the future. In Swedish school restaurants tons of food is being thrown away every day. A large part of the dilemma lies in the unawareness of the problem. To overcome this and reach out, knowledge and information are needed. <br><br>Wasteless is an app which aims to help Swedish schools to reduce food waste.

          <p>
            Wasteless draws attention to the food waste problem in Swedish school canteens. The participating students compete to get the highest score, which means the least waste. By using elements from game design, the app can utilize the triggers and driving forces experienced in-game contexts, contributing to increased motivation, commitment, and fun. In addition, the school management gets access to the data generated from the app. This way, the meal routines in school canteens can be improved, which not only saves the earth’s resources, but also improves school finances.

          <p>
            This project is based on <strong>research</strong> of food waste, motivational theories associated with behavior change, and gamification. External analyzes have been made by reviewing previous strategies for reducing food waste in school canteens and looking at a successful concept of gamification. We have taken in the means proven effective in behavior change and gamification and conducted several <strong>user interviews</strong> to test these. The design process has been <strong>iterative.</strong> We have included users from the start to create and design adapted to the target group's interests and to land in a user-friendly product.

            It was essential to get a playful and friendly feeling to the design to remove the sense of "a boring topic" that many may associate with food waste. Therefore a friendly and casual language was used to induce a warm feeling. Furthermore, large border-radius and rounded shapes were used that, combined with the intriguing illustrations and images, lifts the sense of a fun and straightforward design that can entice users to see the joy in the product.</p>

          <p>
            In each dining room where Wasteless is used, a digital scale will be available for the students to use.Through scan technology, the number of grams and the corresponding score are entered. This is done automatically to minimize the risk of cheating among users.

            The management of each participating school gets access to all data that the app has collected about the school's food waste.  This makes it is easy to see where there is room for improvement. <br><br>The admin page is available for principals, teachers, and catering staff. The management team can measure everything from active users, days and dishes with the most and least wastage to detailed food waste statistics. Based on this, various measures can be taken to find new routines that can improve the food waste statistics in schools.

          With the pressure of a tight budget and deadlines, it was difficult to redirect the clients focus from the next feature and onto the customer. We were able to get regular updates from customer support and analytics, but weren’t able to gather important qualitative feedback. This made it difficult to help our client make evidence based decisions with ongoing features. This isn't an uncommon issue, and wasn't solved from simply raising these issues in meetings. Running small workshops to discuss feature desirability of customers could have been an effective way to expose important unknowns and encourage directional research.
